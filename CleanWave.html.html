    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
    <p>When you're ready to start making a difference on CleanWave, it's time to roll up your sleeves and capture the essence of your ocean cleanup activities in the most compelling way possible. This is your opportunity to not only clean up our beautiful beaches, shorelines, and water bodies but also to inspire and engage a global community of like-minded individuals. Ensure that your videos are clear, well-documented, and thoughtfully edited to effectively demonstrate your contribution. Highlight the extent of the pollution you're addressing, the magnitude of waste collected, and the positive transformation you're bringing to the environment. Share your passion and dedication, as well as any unique techniques or insights you have developed in your cleanup efforts. By doing so, you're not only contributing to the CleanWave mission but also motivating others to take part and collectively make a lasting impact on the health and sustainability of our oceans. Your videos will serve as a powerful testament to the difference every individual can make in the fight against ocean pollution and the preservation of our planet's natural beauty.</p>
